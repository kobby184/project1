# Character Strengths Analysis of Homeless and Non-Homeless U.S. Veterans

## Introduction  
This project analyzes character strengths among U.S. veterans, comparing differences between homeless and non-homeless veterans. Using data from the VIA Institute on Character, the goal is to uncover correlations between character traits and homelessness.

## Dataset Overview  
Source: VIA Institute on Character  
The dataset includes [key details].

## Project Workflow  
1. Data Preprocessing  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Statistical Analysis  
4. Visualization  
5. Conclusion  

## Requirements  
- Python 3.9+  
- Required libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn  

## Setup and Installation
